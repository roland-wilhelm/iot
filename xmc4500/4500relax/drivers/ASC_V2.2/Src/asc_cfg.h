  @topic1 Configuring the ASC HAL |
  Although the ASC HAL can be used immediately without configuring it to suit a 
  particular application it will often be the case that some features written 
  into the HAL will either be unnecessary; degrade performance to an 
  unacceptable level, take up too much memory or only be required for debugging
   purposes. For this reason the ASC HAL has been designed in such a way that 
   it can be easily configured to remove unused features, a number of optional
    features may be enabled and/or disabled through the ASC_CFG.h file:

  되SC device number checking

  될nitialisation check on API calls

  Additionally further options which affect the ASC HAL may be present in the 
  System HAL. Depending on the actual system in question these, or other, 
  options may be available:

  됦n the fly peripheral clock changing

  될nitial interrupts numbers/priorities settings

  되SC physical interface (GPIO) configuration

  The System HAL User Guide should be available from the same source as this 
  document, please refer to it for more details on the available settings
   and features.
