/* 
	Error 65: Access violation at ... : No 'write' permission:
	When the µVision Debugger loads an executable program, it creates a memory map 
	using the program and data segments from the program. Code segments are marked as 
	executable while data segments are marked as read/write. 
	All other memory is unmapped and is, therefore, not marked for any type of access.
	The µVision Debugger checks that all memory accesses are made to objects that 
	are defined in your C program. For any access that is outside of a defined C object, 
	the µVision debugger generates an error 65: access violation message.
	By default, the debugger allows only memory accesses to valid data objects. 
	This is useful for finding uninitialized or incorrectly initialized pointers, for example. 
	Usually, there is a programming error when you try to access unexpected locations.
	
	Enable memory regions for absolute memory accesses within the EMAC area
