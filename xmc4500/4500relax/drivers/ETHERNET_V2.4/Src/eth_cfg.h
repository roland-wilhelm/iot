  @topic2 Configuring the Ethernet HAL |
  Although the Ethernet HAL can be used immediately without configuring it to 
  suit a particular application it will often be the case that some features 
  written into the HAL will either be unnecessary; degrade performance to an 
  unacceptable level, take up too much memory or only be required for debugging
  purposes. For this reason the Ethernet HAL has been designed in such a way 
  that it can be easily configured to remove unused features, a number of 
  optional features may be enabled and/or disabled through the ETH_CFG.H file:

  된TH device number checking

  될nitialisation check on API calls

  Additionally further options which affect the Ethernet HAL may be present in 
  the System HAL. Depending on the actual system in question these, or other, 
  options may be available:

  됦n the fly peripheral clock changing

  될nitial interrupts numbers/priorities settings

  된TH physical interface (GPIO) configuration

  The System HAL User Guide should be available from the same source as this 
  document, please refer to it for more details on the available settings 
  and features.
