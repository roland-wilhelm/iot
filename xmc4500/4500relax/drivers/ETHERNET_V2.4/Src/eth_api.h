    @topic2 Ethernet HAL Application Program Interface |
    This section defines the interface between the peripheral hardware 
    abstraction layer and the application software. It defines the constants, 
    typedef names, function names and limitations of the HAL.
    The Ethernet HAL API utilizes a range of constants and typedef names in 
    order to interact in a logical way with the application program. 
    The first section of this chapter will look at these constants and data 
    types.
    
    Please refer to Appendix A - Infineon IFX types for details on the IFX data
    types.
