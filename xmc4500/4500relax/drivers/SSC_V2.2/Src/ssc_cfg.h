  @topic1 Configure/Optimise SSC HAL |
  Although the SSC HAL can be used immediately without configuring it to suit a 
  particular application it will often be the case that some features written into 
  the HAL will either be unnecessary; degrade performance to an unacceptable level, 
  take up too much memory or only be required for debugging purposes. For this 
  reason the SSC HAL has been designed in such a way that it can be easily configured 
  to remove unused features, a number of optional features may be enabled and/or 
  disabled through the SSC_CFG.H file:

  됩SC device number checking

  될nitialisation check on API calls

  Additionally further options which affect the SSC HAL may be present in the System HAL. 
  Depending on the actual system in question these, or other, options may be available:

  될nitial interrupts numbers/priorities settings

  됩SC physical interface (GPIO) configuration

  The System HAL User Guide should be available from the same source as this document, 
  please refer to it for more details on the available settings and features.
